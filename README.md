## Lousy Kitchen - Game

Welcome to Louse Kitchen, where no one actually do their jobs properly!
<br>
The waitor is already fired, and you couldn't find a replacement, so you need to get your hands in work for a while.

### How to play

Kitchen crew does a clean work preparing the meals but they always prepare them in the wrong order.
So your mission is to bring the correct orders to the table. 
<br>
If the meals match the table orders, you can click on them to take them to the tray, if not, tell kitchen crew to make new ones by clicking the refresh button.

### How to Win

By completing orders, you earn +5 reputation. When you reach 20 reputation in total, your restaurant is the best known in town! You win the game.
